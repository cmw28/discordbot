# Discord Bot (name is a work in progress)

My goal for this bot is not to be the most useful thing in the world, but to better learn JavaScript.

## Setup

NodeJS is required. Copy example.env to .env and edit it to contain your bot's token. Run `npm i` to install dependencies and `node main.js` to run the bot.
